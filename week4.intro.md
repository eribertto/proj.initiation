Welcome back, and congrats on completing that graded assessment. In the previous
module, you learned all about project roles and responsibilities, and we
introduced you to some tools that you can use to ensure team accountability,
like stakeholder analyses and RACI charts. Coming up, we'll talk about project
tools and resources, and the value of documentation. By the end of this module,
you'll understand the types of resources available to a project manager, you'll
be able to document information in a formal project charter, and you'll be able
to compare and use various project management tools. Ready to get started? Meet
me in the next video.
