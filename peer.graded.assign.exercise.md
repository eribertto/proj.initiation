Activity Overview

In this activity, you will analyze a scenario to identify project goals. Then, you will write the goals using SMART criteria. 

As a reminder, SMART goals must be:

Specific

Measurable

Attainable

Relevant

Time-bound

After you submit your work, review and respond to at least two of your classmates’ assignments. 

Scenario
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.

Office Green’s main goal for this project is: “Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to high-volume clients.”

You recently met with the project sponsor (the Director of Product) to discuss two additional goals for Plant Pals:

"Increase brand awareness" 

"Raise Office Green’s customer retention rate"

 In order to help your team achieve these two additional goals, you need to turn them into SMART goals. The notes from your meeting with the Director of Product are below. You can use this information to create SMART goals:

Office Green’s customer retention rate was 80% last year, but the CEO wants that number to increase by at least 10% this year.

Last year, 70% of customers who left Office Green for competitors said they did so because they wanted more extensive services. When surveyed, 85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals.

The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year—a slight increase over last year. The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years.

The company plans to create an Operations and Training plan for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.

Office Green will promote the new service with a new marketing and sales strategy, a redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page, and a print catalog. 

With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their customer base will grow by at least 15%.

Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from 175K to 155K. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to increase by at least 15K each month. 

The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter. (It is currently the start of Q1.)

Step 2: Revise the goals to be SMART

The template contains the two project goals for Plant Pals, but neither meets all of the SMART criteria. Use the information from the scenario above to turn these goals into SMART goals. Write them next to SMART Goal One and SMART Goal Two. Your goals should be complete, but brief—one or two sentences is enough.

For example, here is an example of a goal that’s missing some of the SMART criteria:

“To help customers care for their plants, Office Green will create an app sometime this year.”

That’s not a bad start, but it isn’t specific, measurable, or time-bound. Here’s the same goal, rewritten as a SMART goal:

“To help customers care for their plants, Office Green will create an app that offers care tips and reminders for specific plants. The app will be completed within 18 months and be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells.”

Step 3: Explain what makes each goal SMART

Now that you’ve rewritten the goals, explain what makes them SMART by answering the following questions:

What makes the goal specific? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?

What makes the goal measurable? Does it include metrics to gauge success?

What makes the goal attainable? Is it realistic given available time and resources?

What makes the goal relevant? Does it support project or business objectives?

What makes the goal time-bound? Does it include a timeline or deadline?

Be specific in your answers. For instance, the example plant care app SMART goal is:

Specific: The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so. 

Measurable: The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.

Attainable: The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app. 

Relevant: Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully. 

Time-bound: The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

If you find that either goal does not meet all of the SMART criteria, try revising it and answering the questions again.
