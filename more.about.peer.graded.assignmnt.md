Optional: What to know about peer-graded assignments

Throughout this course, you will complete a few different types of hands-on activities that let you apply your project management skills in “real-world” situations. These assignments ask you to think through common project management problems, find solutions, and create essential project management artifacts.

For some of these assignments, you’ll need to submit your work for other learners to grade. This peer review process is a central part of the learning experience. It allows you to assess activities objectively against a set rubric, and compare your approach with those of your peers. It also gives you the option to give and receive qualitative feedback.

You’ll need to complete peer-graded assignments in each course, so here’s what you need to know:

How peer-grading works
Before submitting the activity, you can check your work against a list of required items it should contain. Review this list carefully and revise your work before submitting, if necessary. This list matches the rubric your peers will use to grade your assignment (and that you will use to grade theirs). 

You should receive grades from at least two peers for each peer-graded assignment you complete. As a grader, you can review as many submissions as you like, but you must mark at least two assignments to move on in the course. 

Optional feedback
When grading a peer’s assignment, you will have the option to give qualitative feedback. We encourage you to leave thoughtful comments about what they did well and where they can improve. This feedback can help you and your peers understand why you lost points for certain rubric items, so you can do better next time. Each assignment includes tips and examples of good feedback to help you write constructive comments.

Submitting your work
Most assignments involve submitting documents or spreadsheets for review. You have the option to submit your peer-graded assignments as either a URL (to a shared Google doc for example) or as a downloadable file (like a .docx file). To grade your work, your peer reviewers will access the shared doc or download the file you submitted.

Coursera automatically assigns you a personalized deadline for each assignment in the course. Make note of this date and aim to submit your work on time—the earlier, the better. You are more likely to get timely feedback if you turn in your assignment a day or two before the deadline.

What to do if you don’t receive a grade
If you submitted your assignment as a URL, and no one has reviewed it after a few days, check your Google sharing settings to ensure “view” access is enabled. (Visit this resource to learn more about file sharing.) 

If your share settings are correct and you still haven’t received a grade (or if you need assignments to grade yourself), you have two options:

Check when you submitted your assignment. It can take up to a week for grades to appear, so you may need to wait a little longer. New graders and assignments should be available within a few days.

Ask for reviewers (or items to review) in the discussion forums. Posts like this are common, so you can post your submission link for peers to review, or skim through forum posts to find items to grade.

What to do if you need a new assignment to grade
Sometimes, while you’re grading your peers, you may find you aren’t able to access or open a file. If you can’t grade an assignment for any reason, you can skip it and move on to a different submission. To do this, select Flag this submission (located at the upper-right corner of the prompt box in the grading pane):

A link to "flag this submission," with an image of a flag. A link to "flag this submission," with an image of a flag. 
You will be prompted to select a reason for the flag and provide an explanation in the text box:

A "flag this submission" modalA "flag this submission" modal. The selected reason for the flag is "Other (please provide details below)." The explanation given is, 'The sharing settings are not set to "anyone with the link," so I can't access the file.
Once you select Send report, you'll receive a confirmation message and a different submission will appear below.  

Note: Flagging a learner's submission as inaccessible will not affect their grade.
