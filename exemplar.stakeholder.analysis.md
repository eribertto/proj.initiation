Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed stakeholder analysis and power grid. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Note: Some of the information in your stakeholder analysis and power grid may differ from these exemplars. Some variation is to be expected. 

Let’s review the stakeholder analysis table:

The Stakeholder column includes the titles of the five stakeholders (and stakeholder groups) from the scenario. 

Each stakeholder’s role is in the Role column.

Each stakeholder’s involvement (including helpful tools, knowledge, or relationships) is recorded in the Involvement column.

The project’s impact on each stakeholder’s needs (along with any potential resistance ) is described in the Impact column. 

Each stakeholder’s level of power or influence is classified as high (H), medium (M), or low (L) in the Power or Influence column.

Each stakeholder’s level of interest is classified as high (H), medium (M), or low (L) in the Interest column.

The level and type of engagement determined for each stakeholder is recorded in the Engagement column.

Let’s review the power grid:

As the project sponsor, the Director of Product has a high level of influence on the project. They are invested in the project’s success, but not involved on a day-to-day basis, so their interest is medium. You should communicate with them regularly, but not daily, to ensure they are satisfied with project progress.

The Landscape Designer/Web Designer has a high level of both influence and interest, which means you should manage them closely. You should communicate with them daily to discuss project tasks and to ensure you have their buy-in. If you have them on your side, they can help you manage relationships with other Office Green employees.

Existing clients and their employees are the core customer base for Plant Pals, so you need to make sure you’re building something they want to buy. Their feedback can help you measure project success, but you don’t need to communicate with them frequently. Occasional check-ins to gauge their satisfaction are appropriate. This is a large group of people with varying priorities and concerns, so their interest and influence are both marked as medium. 

Office Green’s investors will not be directly involved in the project, so their interest in daily operations is low. However, their influence level is medium, since you need to protect their investment to keep their financial support. Giving them periodic updates on project milestones and performance would be appropriate.

The Office Green receptionist’s influence and interest in the project are both relatively low. You don’t need to communicate with them often until the project nears completion. They are not part of the project team, and you do not need to discuss the details with them until later in the process.
