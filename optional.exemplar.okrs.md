Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed OKRs. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Note: The exemplar gives three key results for each objective, but there are many more you could develop. Because you can measure success in various ways, your lists of key results may differ. The important thing to keep in mind is that your OKRs should help you expand upon your project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project in order to accomplish those goals.

Let’s review each OKR in the exemplar:

OKR #1: Actively and meaningfully engage the public to generate buy-in and project support

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “400 attendees to 12 public meetings focused on transit talks” measures engagement in the number of attendees at public meetings about transit.

OKR #2: Make it easy to get around the greater Wonder City area via public transportation.

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “New ridership increases by 25% within three months” measures the increase in bus ridership in the city in response to the community’s improved ability to get around the city with ease. 

OKR #3: Promote public transportation as a convenient alternative to driving.

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “80% click-through rate from banner ads on social media” measures the success of the promotional campaign in public engagement with social media ads.

OKR #4: Provide a reliable and consistent public transportation service.

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “100% of new busses meet government safety standards at monthly inspections” measures the reliability and consistency of busses that pass regular safety inspections.
