Build a project management tool tracker
As you progress through this course, you will learn about different types of tools used by project managers and the organizations that hire them. Tools can include software applications like Adobe, Google, and Microsoft and specific work management tools like Jira and Asana. They can also include methodologies, techniques, formulas and concepts, and technologies related to project management. 

This reading provides step-by-step instructions for creating a tracker for all of these types of tools. You can use your tracker to list the different tools you learn about, their descriptions and links, their features and benefits, and your level of experience with each. This way, you can easily identify the tools required for different roles and can determine where you might want to focus your professional development efforts.

Developing your tool tracker spreadsheet
Follow these steps to begin creating your project management tool tracker:

Step 1: Create a new spreadsheet
Start by opening a new spreadsheet using your preferred method. If you have a Google account, click the link to open a Project Management Tool Tracker Template.

Some of the information has already been filled in for you as an example. Feel free to modify your Tracker in the way that works best for you.

Step 2: Add column headers
Consider the different types of information you’d like to track about each tool, and add these as column headers in your tracker. (The header is the top cell or cells in a column in the spreadsheet.)

Here are some example column headers:

Tool Name

Description/Benefits

Link to product website

Link to course content in Coursera

Cost to use

Requirements (training/equipment)

Your current experience with the tool

Step 3: Add tools and relevant information
Review some of the course videos, readings, and activities so far that discuss project management tools. Select three or four tools and add the names to the tracker. Add any information you have about each tool to the different columns. To help you get started, the template has several tools listed that have already been mentioned in this course. Feel free to edit the list to include the tools that are most relevant to your progress.

You might not be able to fill in all the columns with information just from this course, so do your own research if necessary.

For example, we discuss the work management tool Asana in the video Common project management tools, but we only cover some of the features and benefits. You can look up the Asana website online and add more information about what features are offered, along with pricing and system requirements.

Step 4: Format your sheet
After you’ve added a few tools and some initial information, format your sheet by bolding column headers and adding drop-down lists, conditional formatting, or web links. Try out other formatting options like bolding, highlighting, or colors to make important text stand out. Google Sheets training and help contains articles with step-by-step directions for how to use all of these features and more.

Step 5: Continue adding tools
Continue to add more tools and information that’s relevant to your career goals. Search job listings and add tools, software, or specific knowledge needed for jobs you’re interested in.
