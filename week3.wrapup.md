Kudos! You finished another module.  That was a fun one! We covered a lot of
topics that were likely new to you. So let's recap. In our first video, we
checked out each individual role associated with projects. You learned that as a
project manager, you'll have to ask yourself key questions to make sure you
build a successful team. You have to consider things like team size, necessary
skills, availability, and motivation. Then you completed a stakeholder analysis.
This helps you understand how you might manage communication with each person on
the project. Next came the RACI chart, which defined rules and responsibilities
for individuals or teams. This helps people get work done efficiently, and it
creates clear lanes and instruction for each team member to operate within. It
does this by assigning which roles are responsible, accountable, informed, and
consulted. Overall, you learned some really useful concrete tools to help you
stay organized throughout the project. You can use these charts as you work with
your stakeholders. And if your project is ever-evolving, as some are,
stakeholder mapping and RACI charting will help you stay on top of the tasks and
communicate effectively. In the next module, you'll learn about other useful
resources for managing projects and discover how to know which tool to use when.
See you soon.
